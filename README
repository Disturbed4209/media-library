This is a php service to help viewing streaming videos. You will read all your
 movies in a sorted list and, once you've chosen one of those, you will just
 use the hyperlink to download a m3u file which points to the stream file.
What you need is to setup a video directory where to put all your videos. If 
 videos are stored in a different dir video-server will recognize them as a 
 fiction. 
Once you've set your movies directory, you will write its path under ROOT_PATH
 in index.php. Leave everything else as it is.
Check root dir allows apache to access and read every file.
