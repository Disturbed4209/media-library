Media Library
=============

Do you have a pc where you store all your movies, your TV series or any other
madia, and you want to watch them from your laptop, your smartphone, at home or
anywhere else?

Media Library is a service that keeps track of all your media, lets you choose
what you want to watch and gives you a light m3u file that you can use to
stream your files with your favourite media player.

Setup
-----

Easy peasy! Just put all your media in a folder, put its path under ROOT_PATH,
in index.php and you're done.

For now, Media Library will get only files in the ROOT_PATH folder. Each
subfolder is seen as a TV serie and will be downloaded as a single playlist.

You can also save images with same name of the file to have a cool preview of
it.

Future
------

I would like to add a lot of features, such as:

- Automatically converting videos in a light format
- Building custom playlists
- Browsing subfolders
- Automatically generating preview images from videos

Unfortunately, I don't have enough time, so I would appreciate any contribute.
